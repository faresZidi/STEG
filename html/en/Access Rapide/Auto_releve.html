                <h2>When is the reading performed?</h2>
                <p>
                    The index reading is performed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every four months in urban areas</li>
                    <li>Every six months in rural areas</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One out of two bills is estimated.</p>

                <h2>Self-Reading:</h2>
                <p>
                    To replace the intermediate or estimated bill with an actual consumption bill, you can record your meter readings yourself and submit them to your district directly or via our website through your client space by entering the readings recorded on your meters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of prolonged absence exceeding two months, and to avoid advance billing, submit the <a href="#" class="highlight">Remote Self-Reading</a> form to your district.
                </p>

                <h2>What is self-reading?</h2>
                <p>
                    With the self-reading service, you can record the readings of your electricity and/or gas meters yourself remotely and immediately receive an actual consumption bill that cancels and replaces the estimated or intermediate bill.
                </p>

                <h2>How to use the self-reading service and pay your bill?</h2>
                <p>
                    To cancel estimated or intermediate bills and pay an actual consumption bill without traveling, please:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access your <a href="https://www.steg.com.tn" target="_blank">STEG client space</a> via the website <span class="highlight">www.steg.com.tn</span> using your login and password after registration.</li>
                    <li>Click on <strong>Add Reference</strong> to <strong>View/Pay</strong> your bill.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your displayed bill is estimated or intermediate, you will find the Self-Reading option at the bottom of the bill:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Self-Reading</strong> icon and enter the new readings of your electricity and/or gas meters:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">All the numbers</span> visible on the dial for the <strong>electricity</strong> meter.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">The first numbers in black</span> on the left of the dial for the <strong>gas</strong> meter.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Following the Self-Reading operation, you will immediately receive a bill based on your readings that cancels and replaces your estimated or intermediate bill. You can view and/or pay it through the website by clicking the "Pay" button or by any other payment method you choose.
